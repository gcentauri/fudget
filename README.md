# fudget
a low tech diy budgeting application

so far the idea is to run a local server to which you can easily send plain text
data from a phone or other device.  current plan is to use yaml, but csv or 
any other simple serial data format could work too.

essentially, your phone becomes a glorified check register, and fudget is your
finance app.  use fudget to build a budget and create envelopes to track spending
